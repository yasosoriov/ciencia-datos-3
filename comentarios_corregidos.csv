"Oh wow, this was amazing. Twilightenment indeed! My only criticism is that even for me, the video is kinda too long, which means I can't remember all the stuff I wanna comment on. But awesome, and funny, and love the little ironic stabs everywhere.

My main takeaway from the vid would be ""Let women's fantasy lead the way!"" Incredible how it all works, and you've been able to articulate things about the fantasy genre that I've always sensed but couldn't really explain. It's the thing that frustrates me the most, often feeling like I'm reaching for something just out of reach.... But dare I say I'm not surprised that it's within another queer space that some of those answers can be found.

I'm an aro/ace cis tomboy, and I remember the whole sex-negative feminism thing used to resonate with me - when I was in the closet! I never wanted to be a nun though, it always struck me as being untruthful about something, like hiding from the world because they couldn't tell the world. Right? 

""Samsara is my stomping ground,"" haha yes, like why do some people hate being here so much? Life, rebirth and cycles are fine. I have to say however, that no, peace is not just for the Wise - if one has peace, then the excitement is even better. Less distractions from the fun, as it were. 

Also wanna point out that Adam was in fact gay - so the whole story of him and Eve (or Lilith) has to be reexamined through that lens, as opposed to it being about ""the genders"" or about the ""inherently violent nature of romance"" as a thing. There is no inherently violent nature to sexuality if the partners are true mates (like in Eden, the Magic Kingdom). The violence only came about as a result of Adam (gay) having kids with a woman (aka introducing Death). 

What the myth says however is that yes, there is the violence as a result of ""veiling the Sun"" (gayness) but Adam (the Sun) never actually veiled himself, just continued to be who he was. The Jesus story then purports to show who that was (introducing Resurrection and ""redeeming Adam and Eve"" -- redemption is a misunderstood word by the way). 

Apparently people in the old days knew this, because Eve was not ""torn from Adam's side,"" she is painted as coming into existence from the Void *behind Adam, when he's sleeping, and Eve is reaching for God (the Master of the Universe) from that Void. The God is the true mate, basically that was the ancient term for spirit-husband (which religion has since demonised). ""Vegetarian vampire"" üòÇ

Fantasy is Lilith's relationship to Adam/Lucifer that ""gave her Desire for Man"" (meaning that HE had this Desire for Man that he transfered to her, but she's still ""the virgin"" when she has the kids/baby monsters/immortals). So women who write m/m fanfic are actually Lilith's descendants identifying with men (equality) and going back to Paradise in the now. (Lilith writes vampire fic too, but that's another story entirely! Lol!)

I feel like the whole ""You can't choose how you feel"" is a misrepresentation of what Love is, but now I finally get what Freddie Mercury was saying about ""being possessed by love, isn't everybody?"". Lol nope. I notice that yeah, aces do question that a bit more, or why anyone would seek the drama at all. Feelings are created by thoughts, and we choose our own thoughts. BUT if we only put half of our thoughts into it (by rejecting the Master of the Universe üòä) then it's not what we choose at all. 

So Love is the Demon who works for God, as King James' Daemonologie suggests.

"I had a history of art professor talk about how women are taught to view themselves as subjects and hence to construct themselves by viewing themselves through the perspective of men. In this, I think, women are taught to inhabit the male viewpoint as an inherent part of their gender performance (I think you touch on this a bit with the ‚ÄúGay boys on the internet; the only people with any vision of contemporary womanhood‚Äù bit in the Aesthetic video (I‚Äôm quoting directly but only from memory, so fuck knows if this is actually what you said). In relation to art, this manifests in the female nude, where men paint women nude, and critique the woman in the painting for being nude, because it is inherent to her womanhood that she is aware of the voyerism of men watching her, regardless of the fact that it was a man who painted her nude. (I‚Äôm paraphrasing but there‚Äôs a really gorgeous bit on this in Berger‚Äôs 'Ways of Seeing' - Chapter 3 'The Nude') which feels vaguely relevant. ‚ÄúA woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. Whilst she is walking across a room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually.
And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the
surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman.
She has to survey everything she is and everything
she does because how she appears to others, and ultimately how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another.
Men survey women before treating them.
Consequently how a woman appears to a man can determine how she will be treated. To acquire some control over this process, women must contain it and interiorize it. That part of a woman's self which is the surveyor treats the part which is the surveyed so as to demonstrate to others how her whole self would like to be treated. [‚Ä¶]
In the art-form of the European nude the painters
and spectator-owners were usually men and the persons treated as objects, usually women. This unequal relationship is so deeply embedded in our culture that it still structures the consciousness of many women. They do to themselves what men do to them. They survey, like men, their own femininity.‚Äù girlie also goes more into the arty stuff if you fancy reading it, it‚Äôs really interesting!",@jatyamxx,0,2025-05-18T16:32:50Z,205,0.1968390804597701,positive,,history art professor talk woman teach view subject hence construct view perspective man think woman teach inhabit male viewpoint inherent part gender performance think touch bit gay boy internet people vision contemporary womanhood bit aesthetic video quote directly memory fuck know actually say relation art manifest female nude man paint woman nude critique woman painting nude inherent womanhood aware voyerism man watch regardless fact man paint nude paraphrase really gorgeous bit berger way see chapter 3 nude feel vaguely relevant woman must continually watch almost continually accompany image whilst walk across room whilst weep death father scarcely avoid envisage walk weep early childhood teach persuade survey continuallyand come consider surveyor thesurveye within two constituent yet always distinct element identity womanshe survey everything everythingshe appear other ultimately appear man crucial importance normally think success life sense supplant sense appreciate anotherman survey woman treat themconsequently woman appear man determine treat acquire control process woman must contain interiorize part womans self surveyor treat part survey demonstrate other whole self would like treat artform european nude paintersand spectatorowner usually man person treat object usually women unequal relationship deeply embed culture still structure consciousness many woman man survey like man femininity girlie also go arty stuff fancy read really interesting,positive,LABEL_1,neutral,neutral

"I was curious when the first Eclipse movie came out. 

I had only ever read the Twilight saga through a snark site, but, curiosity got the better of me, and I had this urge to see the Eclipse movie.

At this time, I had a young male coworker who was one of the coolest, most quirky young men I've ever had the pleasure to know. He was around the same age as my own boys, who had 0 interest in anything romance related. Anyway,  this young man  loved Twilight, unironically and unabashedly and out loud. When I casually mentioned I wouldn hate seeing Eclipse, he offered to go with me. He'd only seen it maybe five times by that point. üòÖ

So, ""Luke"" and I went to the movies. üçø  I treated; I got our tickets, our popcorn, our drinks, and, seeing the movie with Luke kinda made me love it. I could snark about it all day long, but, I'm a little tired of flippancy, irony, hatewatching/reading/listening.  It was refreshing to experience it with a true fan. 

It's okay to like ""basic"" things, even works with problematic aspects. 

The one thing I challenged Luke about was Harry Potter. (This was long before Joanne lost the plot, and colluded with her moldy walls to make being a TERF her entire personality.) Luke came from a conservative fundamentalist Christian family, which prohibited anything HP. I asked him why wizards were verboten, but vampires and werewolves were okay, and he really couldn't explain it, but he went along with it. üòÖ  

(Hard to remember that time or era, when HP's controversy was its subject matter, not its batshit author. I'm mom to a transgender young adult daughter, and Joanne and anything she produces is anathema to me. Like seriously, fuck her and her minions. But, that same trans person,  as a child, and before Joanne lost her mind, enjoyed HP books immensely.

"Misogyny does not have anything to do with ""men's contempt for women""  Mirriam Webster definition of misogony: feeling, showing, or characterized by hatred of or prejudice against women¬†:¬†of, relating to, or being a¬†misogynist and misogynist is defined as a person who hates or discriminates against women.   Notice how the only gender mentioned is that of the recipient of the hate.  It leaves room for the massive amount of hatred women have for other women.  Would disliking what teenage girls like being misogyny?  I would argue no if the hatred is directed exclusively at the behavior of teenagers, and not all the behaviors associated with womanhood.

"i'm quite deep in biology and evolutionary psychology and tbh it feel completely rational considering our past.

Women do not have the physical strength to stop a men in nature. Thousands of years ago a ""bad"" men who really wanted to get you, would probably have. If you fought them back, you would get beaten, if you gave the guy what he wanted, he might be kind to you the next day.

Then there was endless eras of war, where one day you might just be the villager that got taken over, saw your dead husband by the city gate and now the bad men who just killed your husband is calling the shots and one of them is looking at you. Do you fight them off and act bad toward those who just killed your last husband, or would you have accepted your new husband?

It's fucked up but evolution is fucked up and it will evolve you the brain that will survive these realities better. Which in this case might just be to sleep with the devil to pacify him.

Don't know if you ever say ducks mating? It's generally quite savage gangbangs, where a dozen males swarms a duckette all at the same time and she just get pushed around the place by this army of lustful ducks. Will evolution give a brain to these duckettes that think this is horrible rape? or is it gonna give a brain that get aroused when it happen.. and anyway the duck she's into is gonna be the only one to reach her true vagina, not one of the many dead end vagina reserved to the least attractive ducks..

Evolution can be fucked up and you would never have stopped a dangerous men in the past, so you fucked them and kinda liked it.

I'm not against the kink in general. as a man i like dominating and degrading but in a role play manner. I also like when the girl can be aggressively demanding when horny, alto it almost impossible to feel dominated by a women unless i completely act it out because... i can lift them with 1 arm easy.. whatever she's doing is not gonna be very intimidating. If it feels good and the limits are respected, why not have fun?? Problem his some girls do not know where these dark fantasies come from and sometime date actual assholes and real sickos because they get horny from that. 

Basically this kink is the best example of internalized misogyny you could come across, literally sleeping with your rapist to prevent the worst outcomes. If it's toxic to you, you shouldn't do it. If you have a partner that respect your boundaries, you can indulge in it but it's still kind of fucked up.",@fredericklehoux7160,0,2025-04-25T02:45:30Z,225,-0.055550401978973395,neutral,,quite deep biology evolutionary psychology tbh feel completely rational consider past woman physical strength stop man nature thousand year ago bad man really want get would probably fight back would get beat give guy want might kind next day endless era war one day might villager get take see dead husband city gate bad man kill husband call shot one look fight act bad toward kill last husband would accept new husband fuck evolution fuck evolve brain survive reality well case might sleep devil pacify not know ever say duck mate generally quite savage gangbang dozen male swarm duckette time get push around place army lustful duck evolution give brain duckette think horrible rape go to give brain get arouse happen anyway duck go to one reach true vagina one many dead end vagina reserve least attractive duck evolution fuck would never stop dangerous man past fuck kinda like itim kink general man like dominate degrading role play manner also like girl aggressively demand horny alto almost impossible feel dominate woman unless completely act lift 1 arm easy whatever go to intimidating feel good limit respect fun problem girl know dark fantasy come sometime date actual asshole real sickos get horny basically kink good example internalized misogyny could come across literally sleep rapist prevent bad outcome toxic not partner respect boundary indulge still kind fuck,neutral,LABEL_0,negative,neutral
